sudo ufw allow 5601/tcp


-Versions that are not compatible; Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and Filebeat must be in the same version.
-Conflict between different web services:
Nginx think to stop apache2 sudo service apache2 stop and create the sitesvailable folder in Nginx. You can use the command sudo lsof -i:80 to list the processes in progress and the ports used.
-Bad Gateway error, check the configuration files especially those of kibana, the error usually comes from an invalid ip. 
-The firewall blocking the entries / exits (ufw inactive) for that here are the commands to make to activate the authorization:
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw default deny
sudo iptables -L    
sudo ufw allow 5601/tcp

Setting up SSL for elasticsearch


Create the file /usr/share/elasticsearch/instances.yml 
nano /usr/share/elasticsearch/instances.yml


Create the required certificates, private keys and the certificate authority (CA)
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert ca --pem --in instances.yml --out certs.zip


Extract the generated /usr/share/elasticsearch/certs.zip file
unzip /usr/share/elasticsearch/certs.zip -d /usr/share/elasticsearch/
Configure SSL in Elasticsearch


Create the directory /etc/elasticsearch/certs, then copy the certificate
authorities, the certificate and the key.
mkdir /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca -p
cp /usr/share/elasticsearch/ca/ca.crt /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca
cp /usr/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.crt
/etc/elasticsearch/certs
cp /usr/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.key
/etc/elasticsearch/certs
chown -R elasticsearch: /etc/elasticsearch/certs
chmod -R 770 /etc/elasticsearch/certs


Add the proper settings for both the transport and the HTTP layers in
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml.
nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
# Unbind to a specific IP:
network.host: 172.16.5.116
discovery.seed_hosts: ["172.30.0.20"]

# Browser from/to Kibana
server.ssl.enabled: true
server.ssl.certificate: "/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt"
server.ssl.key: "/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key"

Restart the service:
systemctl restart kibana
Adding authentication for Elasticsearch
X-Pack security also provides authentication within each component. The
credentials are configured in the Elastic Server using Elasticsearch directly.

Add x.pack.security.enabled to /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml.
echo 'xpack.security.enabled: true' >> /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

Restart Elasticsearch and wait for the service to be ready.
systemctl restart elasticsearch

When Elasticsearch finishes restarting, generate credentials for all the
Elastic Stack pre-built roles and users.
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive

When prompted confirm you wish to continue and provide a password.
Then provide a password for each one of the components as prompted.

Restart Elasticsearch and wait for the service to be ready.
systemctl restart elasticsearch

Set up credentials for Kibana by adding the following lines to
/etc/kibana/kibana.yml
nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
xpack.security.enabled: true
elasticsearch.username: "elastic"
elasticsearch.password: "password_provided_for_elastic"
Note that you may use the “elastic” user and the password you configured for
it in the previous step.

Restart Kibana.
systemctl restart kibana
Log in to Kibana to verify it is working
